One-stop shop smart contract and dApp development frameworks are also provided to quickly bootstrap developers and get them up and running as architects for the next-generation Internet."]

Over the last few years VS Code has emerged as a top choice for developers, cornering over half of the current market share for code editors. This made it a natural choice for integration with Neo tooling, helping the platform meet developers where they already are."]
