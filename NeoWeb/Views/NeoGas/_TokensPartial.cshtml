    Neo is unique in that it was the first public blockchain platform to adopt a dual token mechanism. It separates the rights of governance from the rights of using the network. It also provides a means of aquiring the tokens needed to pay transaction fees.

            NEO holders participate in governance by voting for the Neo Council, comprised of members and consensus nodes that govern the Neo blockchain. The Neo Council provides specific services, such as maintaining the liveness of the network and adjusting critical blockchain parameters.

            The minimum unit of NEO is 1 and tokens are indivisible. This means if you are withdrawing from an exchange to your wallet, you must withdraw in whole numbers. It also means that NEO is one of the scarcest public blockchain tokens, as it cannot be broken down into smaller peices.

            100 million NEO were generated at genesis, with approximately 50% sold through a public token sale, and the other 50% reserved by the Neo Foundation to insentivise the development of the Neo ecosystem. It's release schedule can be found in the Neo White Paper.

    <div class="headline lighter">
        The Neo network charges GAS for the operation and storage of tokens and smart contracts, thereby creating economic incentives for consensus nodes and preventing the abuse of resources.

        <div class="col">
            The minimum unit of GAS is 0.00000001. There is no NEO staking required in order to claim GAS tokens. Most Neo wallets will include a  claim function, allowing you to collect your GAS with the click of a button. Please be aware that some exchanges distribute GAS to users that hold NEO on their platform, and others do not.
            <br /><br />
            The largest portion of GAS is distributed to voters as a reward for playing an active role in network governance. NEO holders will need to ensure they choose a wallet that supports voting if they wish to participate.
